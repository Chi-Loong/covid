# SG Covid Clusters in the community

Covid19 clusters in the SG community during the High Alert phase. Dataset starts from 28th April 2021

Data source is from [MOH Covid site](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19)

By manually tagging and indexing all the cases, it is:

* allows us, at a glance, to intuitively get case relationship insights
* is easier to update for reporting than having to draw out the clusters or refer to the press release annexes.
* allows us to search and find each case by ID in the dataset (tedious and difficult on the MOH site).
* allows us to search and find cases via occupation or organization. E.g. searching "cleaner" highlights all cases tagged with "cleaner".
