# SG Covid Clusters in the community

Covid clusters in the SG community during the High Alert phase (May, June 2021). Dataset starts from 28th April 2021, start of the TTSH cluster.

Data source is from [MOH Covid site](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19)

By manually tagging and indexing all the cases, it is:

* allows us, at a glance, to intuitively get case relationship insights.
* is easier to update for reporting than having to draw out the clusters or refer to the press release annexes.
* allows us to search and find each case by ID in the dataset (tedious and difficult on the MOH site).
* allows us to search and find cases via occupation or organization. E.g. searching "cleaner" highlights all cases tagged with "cleaner".
* shows summary statistics of all cases or a searched subset.
* allows us to select a subset of a category more easily - a specific date, age band, etc. E.g. clicking the 30-40 bar under the "age" tab, it toggles the view for this specific subset.
